INSTALLATION
install by running:

ruby extconf.rb   # Option --with-smb-dir=/usr/local/samba-x.x.x
                  # to specify location of samba lib.
make

make install      # As root, perhaps.

Also: make sure you have a file named smb.conf in a directory named .smb in
your home directory (ie ~/.smb/smb.conf), or libsmbclient won't load.
(It will fail and raise a "file not found".) It's possible you have such a
file named /etc/smb.conf, but if it doesn't work, just copy that one...
You might want to put config in it (such as WINS server, hostname,
internationalization options, etc). See the smb.conf man file for details.


LIBSMBCLIENT
Ruby/SMB requires libsmbclient, a library included in samba.
To get it, go to http://www.samba.org/ and download the latest version, untar
it, and run:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local # Or perhaps some other dir,
                                # will only install in lib and include.
make libsmbclient

make installclientlib

 * Samba 2.2:
   My computer had problems with its 'make installclientlib'. Use
   '/usr/bin/install bin/libsmbclient.so /usr/local/lib' to install if this is
   the case (or some other destination) and run ldconfig, as usual.

 * Samba 3.0:
   Note that samba 3.0 is alpha, so you might have to tweak the code a bit to
   get it to compile. Some things aren't working as they should either, but
   in general, it's usable. I use it. =)
